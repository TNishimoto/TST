# Truncated Suffix Tree

This program is a C++ implementation of the truncated suffix tree with space-efficient representation. 
Our implementation is based on the idea in [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751500523X].

Let Q be the number of distinct q-grams in input string T.
Then this truncated suffix tree uses O(Q) space.
